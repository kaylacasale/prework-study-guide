# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, my motivation for creating the Prework Study Guide Webpage was to structure my prework notes online so that I can easily find and read information. I built this project using the Terminal and VS Code, separating subheadings such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, into organized sections so to that I could easily view Prework Study Guide notes by topic. Each section contains notes about a certain topic (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git), and if we open the Chrome DevTools console in a Default Browser, we can see the JavaScript running. Instead of having to choose from several topics, it will list the topics we learned from the Prework and choose one topic for us to study first. I have learned the basics of XCode and VS Code, along with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub in order to create a page with content through code and keep track of the changes in code added to my project. Deploying this webpage, or making it into a "live" website on the internet will allow other users to access the content to and learn code. I also learned about the importance of a README file for each project that is important to your public identity as a developer.

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Given a Prework Study Guide website, when you visit the website on my browser, then you can see four boxes titled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with associated notes listed. When you open the console in my browser and access the Chrome DevTools, you can see the four topics listed along with suggestions on what you should study first. When you visit the website using the URL, then you can access the website from any browser.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
